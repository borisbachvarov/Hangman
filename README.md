# Hangman — Java Capstone Project

A capstone projecy along the of revisting the basics of java with the help of the Java Development Bootcamp by Rayan Slim 

This project pulls together core concepts from the course:
arrays, user input, loops, game logic, and a whole lot of trial and error.

## 🎮 What the Game Does

- Picks a random word from a list of animals  
- Shows the classic hangman ASCII art as you play  
- Lets the user guess letters one by one  
- Fills in the correct letters and tracks the wrong ones  
- Ends when the word is guessed or the stick figure meets his tragic fate  

It’s simple, but surprisingly fun to watch it all work together.
